## RenyiEntropy-thresholding-for-particle-analysis
This software package comprises an image processing algorithm that utilizes the Renyi entropy thresholding method to analyze particles present in images. Specifically, the algorithm is designed to process all images contained within a designated MATLAB working directory.

## Overview
This MATLAB code implements an image processing algorithm that applies the Renyi entropy thresholding method to analyze particles within images. Specifically, the algorithm processes all images located in a specified MATLAB working directory.

## Requirements
To use this code, the following requirements must be met:

MATLAB R2018b or newer
Image Processing Toolbox

## Installation
Clone or download the repository containing the MATLAB code to a local directory.
Open MATLAB and navigate to the local directory containing the MATLAB code.
Set the MATLAB working directory to the same directory you are working on.

## Usage
To run the image processing algorithm, follow these steps:

Ensure that all image files to be analyzed are located in the MATLAB working directory.
Open the MATLAB code in MATLAB.
Run the MATLAB code.
The algorithm will process each image in the MATLAB working directory and output the results of particle analysis for each image in an Excel file.

## Troubleshooting
If the code fails to execute, try the following:

Ensure that all image files to be analyzed are located in the MATLAB working directory.
Ensure that the MATLAB working directory is correctly set to the directory containing the MATLAB code.
Ensure that the required MATLAB toolbox (Image Processing Toolbox) is installed and accessible.
